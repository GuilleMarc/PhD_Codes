This repository contains several scripts I wrote in several projects during
my PhD in the agronomy department at Iowa State University.

- A meta-analysis of winter cover crop effects on maize yields
- A sensitivity analysis of cover crop parameters in a process-based simulation system
- Nuts and bolts of a simple parametrization to improve phenology and biomass of a rye cultivar

I have done minimal maintenance to it so is included here for reference purposes only.
